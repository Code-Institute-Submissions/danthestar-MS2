### Website presents "Znake" my first 2D JavaScript Game built form scratch and with still low knowledge on JS with attempt of creating the usual snake game.

### This project is for educational purposes and can not be used as a template for a business use. Website is aboute the game "snake", a simple game made by html css and mostly of the code is writen in JS files.

## UX
---
---
## Owner goals
---
#### Goal was to build simple and intresting website/Game  on 2D plane.
#### One of the reason way i started to do Coding University it THIS = to be able to create somehting that works and can be applied to everywhere and everyone. One of my huge goals it still to be able to create way more complex structures applications and games in near future, so by doing "Snake " game., that is already huge step for me. 
#### And so far this is the best part for me personaly - even though i don't understand all of JS rules and behaviors, but I am fulfilled while doing this type of work/delight.
---
## User goals
---
### As for user goals
   * encourage others to similar projects 
   * to have fun while playing the game
   * even though we are just beginners this should not prevent us from aiming high
   * more happiness less stressing
   * life is a game
   * less is more 

## **Structure of the website**
---
The website/Game is designed to be minimalistictic, with cleans and simple outlook. Mainly focus was on platforms that have keyboards/arrow keys, but it will be nice if i manage to make them available for the smartphones as well! Sinc eit my first game ever (in coding terms) i will stick again more on side of functionality and code it self how to use it than the visual identity.

## **Wireframes**
---
* I used website [Wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc/ob6oIW) to create a wireframes, with addition of Photoshop ofc.

### **Features Left to Implement**
* defenetly more levels with higer speed or harder dificolty in some maners
* some type of star scoring: so players can leav 1-5 star grade
* it will be nice to make the same game in 3D environment
* implement way more different context, just for practise and it will make game more hi-tech and more attractive!
* implement score name options - leaderboard
* make it multiplayer!!

## **Testing**
---
---

### **Functionality testing** 

  * sinc it a simple game...


### **Compatibility testing**
 Since it originaly made only for keyboard platform, compability testing was smuth on all similar platforms with keyboard.

### Issues during site development

* To be honest, since i was following youtube video only issues was TYPO mistakes. And that usually consume a lot of time and discourages, only to eventually find that the code is good, but it has one letter of excess or missing semicolon that makes the whole code incorrectly.   
* Some of them was me trying to figure it out, how is evrything behave in inspector view., example of grid system

  ![](Znake/assets/mdimg/Screenshot210.jpg)
getting familiar how tiels and ticks work trough inspector options

* New/old issues appears this morning again, this types are actually consistent during entire time working on this project.
  * it not so bad, since it usualy last around 20-30min and then goes away, so im not sure is it lag issues, servers., one of examples below.
  
    ![](Znake/assets/mdimg/wierd.jpg) 
    * sometimes can be quite progres killer, since it shows wrong inputs. And the same code doesn't work any more as it supposed to.

## **Deployment**
---
---
The project was deployed on GitHub Pages. I used Gitpod as a development environment where I commited all changes to github. I used push command in Gitpod to save changes into GitHub.

####  To complete this project I used Code Institute student template: [gitpod-full-template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template)

### **Idea**
* In the beginning i wasn't sure what, how or where to start: what game to make and what style to pick.
  * after consulting my self with student suppoort and my mentor Adegbenga Adeye, i agree with them to stick to something simple
  * so since my entire reason to start doing coding was to be able to start doing in game development or application development, snake game was best pick
* **But since this is my first JS actual coding**, i needed a model that i can follow and understand, those bellow are some of my picks form where i was able to recreate my Znake game
    
  * i try my best to not use same names as the source of my code, so by doing that i hope i avoid at least some of copy/paste related issues confronting forms about violation of use someone's code
  * and it also beneficial for me if i change all the names - so i can use more of my own thinking in order to figure it out how the code operates
